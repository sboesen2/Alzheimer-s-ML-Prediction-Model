Amyloid Beta isofrom 40,Uniprot: P05067,DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSN,,Yes,,,,,1731.95,3811.41,29.3,0,
Amyloid Beta isoform 42,Uniprot: P05067,DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVV,,Yes,,,,,1901.64,4142.91,50.3,5.638, Considerable difference in structure between the two. Abeta 42 has higher chances of protein interaction and agregation due to properties. Indicates higher relation to Alzheimers related illnesses
